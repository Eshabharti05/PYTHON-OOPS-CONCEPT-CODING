# Python OOP Concepts 🐍👑

A curated collection of Python scripts that explore and explain the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. These examples show how Python breathes life into OOP through classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

This repo includes bite-sized Python scripts covering:

- ✅ Classes & Objects (`class`, `__init__`, attributes, methods)
- 🔐 Encapsulation (private/public variables, getters/setters)
- 🧬 Inheritance (base and derived classes)
- 🎭 Polymorphism (method overriding and duck typing)
- 🧰 Abstraction (abstract base classes using `abc` module)
- 🔄 Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, etc.)
- 🧠 Class vs Static Methods
